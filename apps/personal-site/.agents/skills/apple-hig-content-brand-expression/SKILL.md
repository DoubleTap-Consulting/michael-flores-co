# Apple HIG Content And Brand Expression

Use this skill to make content and visuals feel intentional and cohesive.

## Workflow

1. Read `references/content-brand-expression.md`.
2. Audit page copy for clarity, brevity, and actionability.
3. Audit iconography and imagery for consistency with the visual system.
4. Define content hierarchy rules for headings, body, metadata, and CTAs.
5. Define trust language for privacy and data use where relevant.
6. Refine brand voice while keeping interface language straightforward.

## Implementation Rules

- Keep copy direct, plain, and specific.
- Keep labels and CTA text unambiguous.
- Keep icon style consistent in stroke, fill, size, and metaphor.
- Keep imagery supportive of content goals, not ornamental noise.
- Keep privacy and trust messaging transparent.
- Keep brand expression visible but subordinate to usability.

## Personal-Site Output

Produce these artifacts when asked:

1. Voice and tone guide for the site.
2. Copy rewrites for priority pages and components.
3. Icon and imagery usage rules.
4. Trust and privacy content checklist.
