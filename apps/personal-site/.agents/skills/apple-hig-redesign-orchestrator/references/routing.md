Use this document to choose the right specialist skill quickly, then combine outputs into one delivery plan.

## Routing Matrix

- Foundations scope: visual system, hierarchy, layout rhythm, typography, color, materials, motion.
- Navigation scope: IA, top navigation, side navigation, search strategy, menus, wayfinding.
- Interaction scope: controls, form behavior, state feedback, input modality support.

3. Standardize component interactions and states.
4. Apply responsive and platform-adaptive deltas.
5. Run accessibility remediation and verify.
6. Finalize copy, iconography, and imagery.

## Deliverable Shape

- Plan by implementation phase.
- File/component edit list.
- Validation checklist by skill area.
- Follow-up tasks for unresolved dependencies.
