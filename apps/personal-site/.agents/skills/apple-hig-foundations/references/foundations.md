## Distilled Learnings

1. Build around hierarchy, harmony, and consistency.
2. Keep interfaces familiar, then layer brand expression.
3. Start from readable structure and spacing before adding effects.
4. Treat color and material as semantic tools (grouping, emphasis, state), not decoration.
5. Keep motion purposeful and tied to state change.
6. Use modern material effects like glass only when they improve depth and focus.
7. Preserve legibility and contrast when using translucency.
8. Keep iconography and imagery aligned with the same visual system as typography and layout.

## Application Heuristics For Personal-Site

- Keep one dominant content objective per screen.
- Make every section boundary obvious through spacing and type hierarchy.
- Reuse the same token values across all pages.
- Keep decorative blur, gradient, and glow secondary to text clarity.
- Reduce visual noise before adding advanced effects.
