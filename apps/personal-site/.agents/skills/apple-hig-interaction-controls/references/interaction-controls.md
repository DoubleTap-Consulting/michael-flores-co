## Distilled Learnings

1. Keep control behavior predictable and consistent.
2. Use direct manipulation patterns where possible.
3. Respect pointer expectations on desktop-class environments.
4. Provide immediate feedback for all user actions.
5. Design interactions for multiple input modes.
6. Keep text input and selection workflows efficient.
7. Use gestures to accelerate interaction, not to hide required flows.
8. Reduce friction in common tasks and repeated actions.

## Application Heuristics For Personal-Site

- Use one canonical visual treatment per control type.
- Use consistent hover/focus/active/disabled states across the app.
- Keep loading and async feedback visible.
- Keep form field hints and errors concise and specific.
- Keep pointer, touch, and keyboard pathways equally functional.
