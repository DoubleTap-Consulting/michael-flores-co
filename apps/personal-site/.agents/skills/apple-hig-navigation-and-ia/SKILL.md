# Apple HIG Navigation And IA

Use this skill to simplify structure and keep users oriented.

## Workflow

1. Read `references/navigation-and-ia.md`.
2. Map current content into a shallow information architecture.
3. Define stable top-level navigation labels.
4. Add progressive disclosure for secondary content.
5. Define menu and keyboard behavior for expert users.
6. Validate wayfinding on desktop and mobile.

## Implementation Rules

- Keep top-level destinations few, stable, and clear.
- Prioritize recognition over recall in labels.
- Keep each page answerable: where am I, what can I do, what is next.
- Expose search where content breadth justifies it.
- Use menus for grouped commands and shortcuts, not for hiding core navigation.
- Keep navigation models consistent across breakpoints.

## Personal-Site Output

Produce these artifacts when asked:

1. Revised sitemap.
2. Primary nav spec (desktop + mobile).
3. Menu and keyboard shortcut spec.
4. Page-level wayfinding pattern (breadcrumbs, section anchors, active states).
