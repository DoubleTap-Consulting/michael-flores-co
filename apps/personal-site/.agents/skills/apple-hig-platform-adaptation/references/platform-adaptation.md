## Distilled Learnings

1. Preserve a coherent product identity across platforms.
2. Adapt interaction and density to platform strengths.
3. Prioritize content and key actions in constrained layouts.
4. Use progressive disclosure for advanced functionality.
5. Respect pointer, touch, and remote-like interaction differences.
6. Streamline workflows instead of mirroring every control everywhere.
7. Keep complexity proportional to user context and screen size.

## Application Heuristics For Personal-Site

- Keep the same content model on every device.
- Change navigation mechanics based on viewport and input model.
- Keep desktop keyboard and pointer affordances rich.
- Keep mobile flows brief and action-focused.
- Keep transitions and animation tuned for hardware constraints.
